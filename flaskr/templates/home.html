    Native English speakers typically know between 20,000 and 35,000 words
    (wordcounter.io). In contrast, non-native speakers often have a vocabulary
    ranging from 2,500 to 9,000 words, depending on their exposure and practice
    (The New Yorker) . Even with intensive study, non-natives may still be
    10,000 to 20,000 words behind their native counterparts (CyraCom
    International).
